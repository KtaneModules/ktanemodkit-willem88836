  description: "[i]Have you tried turning it off and on again?[/i]\n\n[b]About[/b]\nTech
    Support is a semi-needy module that occasionally interrupts you, however, also
    requires you cooperate with your professional.\nIncidentally, one of the bomb's
    other modules will break down, rendering it completely inoperable, and an error
    message is shown. \nIt is your task to resolve this issue before the timer runs
    out. \n\n[b]Other Info[/b]\nModule Type is \"TechSupport\".\nThe manual and appendix
    are included in this download and also can be downloaded at Timwi's webpage.\nThis
    mod uses KMBossModule, so your mods can be ignored by it.\n\n[b]Special Thanks[/b]\nThanks
    Itachi/Goofy for allowing me to use the Mystery Module source code. "
