                        <p class="flavour-text">If you manage to disarm a bomb, you can surely manage an airfield, right?</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Two minutes after starting to dismantle the bomb (or 45 seconds if the bomb's total time is less than 10 minutes), the bomb's airfield will open.</li>
                            <li>Incidentally, as indicated by the module's timer, a plane will arrive at one of four landing lanes.</li>
                            <li>Each plane is identified by a serial, city of origin, passenger count, and the amount of luggage it carries.</li>
                            <li>Based on this information, a correct hangar, passenger shuttle, and luggage cart have to be selected, using the three buttons at the right side.</li>
                            <li>When an incorrect hangar, shuttle or cart is chosen, the plane will be delayed.</li>
                            <li>When a new plane arrives at a lane where another is still waiting, it will crash into the occupying one, crashing it and dealing a strike.</li>

                        <h3>Selecting the Correct Passenger Shuttle</h3>
                        <p>Follow instructions listed below to determine the plane's designated passenger shuttle.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If one of the plane's serial letters is contained in its origin's, select shuttle GN-726.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, if the plane's passenger and luggage count are both even, select shuttle GC-120.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, if the origin's name consists of multiple words, or the plane has more luggage than passengers, select shuttle LF-705.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, if the plane's serial number's first letter is in the last fourth of the alphabet, select shuttle DG-780.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, if the plane came in on lane 3 and it has more than 200 luggage, select GC-120.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, if there is a plane present, departing from, or currently approaching all landing lanes, and the cumulative passenger count of their occupying planes is over 800, excluding wrecked lanes, select DO5-62.</li>
                            <li>However, if the plane's origin is either Victoria, Pretoria, or Pyongyang, ignore all rules above and select MQ3-17.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h3>Selecting the Correct Luggage Cart</h3>
                        <p>
                            From the plane's serial number, select the pre-dash characters and translate these to numerical values (A = 1, B = 2, Z = 26), and sum these. 
                            Multiply this number by the plane's number of passengers. 
                            Execute the same method for the serial's post-dash characters, however, instead multiply these with the plane's amount of luggage.
                            Finally, perform an XOR-operation with the sum of these two numbers and the entire serial number (translated similarly as the pre- and post-dash parts of it).
                            By subtracting the number of different luggage carts from this number, until it is smaller than that number, the final result is unveiled. 
                            Add one to this number and you will have found the index of the plane's correct luggage cart. 
                            Use the table below to determine that cart's serial.
