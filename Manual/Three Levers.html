                    <h2>On the Subject of Three Switches</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">So did I just hear three distinct light switch clicks?</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Every time one of the other modules is solved zero or multiple switches need to be flipped.</li>
                        <li>To determine what switches to flip, use the rulessets below. What ruleset is used is switched every solved module, starting with the first ruleset.</li>
                        <li>If a module is solved, but the switches are not in the correct configuration, a strike will be dealt.</li>
                        <li>After a certain percentage of all modules is solved, the indicator light below will turn on.</li>  
                        <li>When this light is on, switch all switches to one side, or to the other side when they are on one side already, to complete the module.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Switch Instruction Set I</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the number of solved modules is a multiplication of 7, flip switch one.</li>
                        <li>If the first letter of the last resolved module is a vowel, flip switch three.</li>
                        <li>If all switches are on the same side, flip switch two.</li>
                        <li>If the solved module was on the timer's side, flip switch three.</li>
                        <li>If you flipped the third switch last time, flip switch two.</li>
                        <li>If you made no mistakes, flip switch one.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Switch Instruction Set II</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you have made a mistake, flip switch two.</li>
                        <li>If all the switches are not on one side, flip switch three.</li>
                        <li>If the last letter of the last resolved module is a vowel, flip switch one.</li>
                        <li>If the solved module was not on the timer's side, flip switch one.</li>
                        <li>If the number of solved modules is a multiplication of 9, flip switch three.</li>
                        <li>If you flipped the first switch last time, flip switch two.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Switch Instruction Set III</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If only the middle switch is up, flip switch one.</li>
                        <li>If you flipped the second switch last time, flip switch two.</li>
                        <li>If the solved module was not on the timer's side, flip switch three.</li>
                        <li>If you have made a two or more mistakes, flip switch two.</li>
                        <li>If the last letter of the last resolved module is a number, flip switch three.</li>
                        <li>If the number of solved modules is a multiplication of 6, flip switch one.</li>
                    </ul>
