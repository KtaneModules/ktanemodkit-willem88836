                    <h2>On the Subject of Three Switches</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">So did I just hear three distinct light switch clicks?</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Every time one of the other modules is solved zero or multiple switches need to be flipped.</li>
                        <li>The rulesets below are used to determine what switches to flip. The ruleset used is incremented every turn, starting with the ruleset that has no corresponding label on the switches.</li>
                        <li>If a module is solved, but the switches are not in the correct configuration, a strike will be dealt.</li>
                        <li>After a certain percentage of all modules is solved, the yellow indicator light will turn on.</li>  
                        <li>When this light is on, switch all switches to one side, or to the other side when they are on one side already, to complete the module.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Instruction Set I</h3>
                    <ul class="rulelist">
                        <li>If the number of solved modules is a multiplication of 7, flip switch one.</li>
                        <li>If the first letter of the last resolved module is a vowel, flip switch three.</li>
                        <li>If the switches are all ON or OFF, flip switch two.</li>
                        <li>If the solved module was on the same side as this module, flip switch three.</li>
                        <li>If the third switch is ON, flip switch three.</li>
                        <li>If you made no mistakes, flip switch one.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Instruction Set II</h3>
                    <ul class="rulelist">
                        <li>If you have made a mistake, flip switch two.</li>
                        <li>If not all the switches are ON or OFF, flip switch three.</li>
                        <li>If the last letter of the last resolved module is a vowel, flip switch one.</li>
                        <li>If the solved module is not on the same side as this module, flip switch one.</li>
                        <li>If the number of solved modules is a multiplication of 9, flip switch three.</li>
                        <li>If the first switch is ON, flip switch two.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Instruction Set III</h3>
                    <ul class="rulelist">
                        <li>If only the middle switch is ON, flip switch one.</li>
                        <li>If you the second switch is ON, flip switch two.</li>
                        <li>If the solved module is not on the same side as this module, flip switch two.</li>
                        <li>If you have made a two or more mistakes, flip switch three.</li>
                        <li>If the last letter of the last resolved module is a number, flip switch three.</li>
                        <li>If the number of solved modules is a multiplication of 6, flip switch one.</li>
