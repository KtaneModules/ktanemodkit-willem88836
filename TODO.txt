## Remember to give credit to "Itachi".
## Update Modkit for custom KMNeedy interrupt intervals. 
## Prevent module from interrupting after the final X minutes.
## Ignore modules that get an a strike (might mess-up the light).
## Implement interrupt that occurs when no modules are available (e.g. when none of the active modules can be blocked).
## Double check what happens when a module is selected and then interrupted (use should be "pushed back").
